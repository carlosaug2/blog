      <description>Being a better human being is a hard task. I know it because I try to be a better person. Day after day. And I just can&amp;rsquo;t.
Of course I would love to write a long post about how I evolved from a disgusting to an awesome person people like to speak with. I am not this kind of person.
But yeah, take note: I am getting better at it.</description>
