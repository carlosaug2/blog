      <description>You may not notice but your environment is ruining your work. Every noise, every interruption or even parallel conversations are slowing down your productivity. Which is a bad thing because it is related to your happiness at your job.
Understanding the problem Ok, you get up early and go to your job. You say &amp;ldquo;good morning&amp;rdquo; to your coleagues, get some coffee, seat, turn on your computer and yay, you are working.</description>
