      <description>A long time ago I decided that I should have a blog to share my thoughts about this kind and cruel world. And it is here now. It was born.
When younger (about 8 years ago) I had a blog I used to share opinions about music and myself. And that was a very good experiencie which helped me evolve as a human being.
Welcome to my blog.</description>
