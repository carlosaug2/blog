      <description>I have been playing League of Legends (aka LoL) for such a long time. And I play it a lot.
It puzzles me whether I am losing or earning time with this.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know the game I am talking about, it is (usually) a 5 x 5 game where you need to destroy the enemy base to win.
In this post I will mostly talk about the toxic culture around the League of Legends community from my perspective.</description>
