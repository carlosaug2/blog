Hello,

Thanks for visiting my website.

Here I write about: people, technology and culture.

I have been a professional developer since 2010 (*Python, golang*). I spend most of my time solving lots of problems in my daily job.
My spare time is precious and I happily spend it talking to [my wife Lais](https://www.instagram.com/laaisbarbosa/) and my very supportive family.
